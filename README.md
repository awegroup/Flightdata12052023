# Kitepower flight data acquired on 12 May 2023

The dataset describes a test flight conducted on 12 May 2023, on farmland next to the village of Dirksland on the island Goeree-Overflakkee in the western Netherlands.
The test flight spanned the time period from 14:14 to 14:32 UTC, completing a total of 8 pumping cycles.
The measured ground wind speed during the flight was between 4 and 10 m/s, the altitude of the kite varied between 100 and 250 m with an airspeed between 20 and 40 m/s.
One of the objectives was the measurement of the acoustic ground footprint of the system <a href="#Bouman2023">[1]</a>.

The wind direction during the test was North East (↙), resulting in the flight direction of the kite being South West. 
The microphone for sound recordings was placed downwind at a distance of 650 m from the ground station. 
The flight zone of the kite, the winch and the location of the microphone are shown in the following illustration.

The following amateur video illustrates the first 2 minutes of the test flight, including the launch of the kite.

A professional TV production around a similar test flight on 6 June 2023 at the same location is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4nypsfnzY) (forward to 4:48 minutes).

## System configuration
For this specific test, the 60m² leading-edge inflatable V9 kite was flown under conservative operational settings. 
The primary focus of the test was data acquisition and sound measurements rather than maximizing energy production. 
As a result, the power output during the flight was significantly lower than that of standard Kitepower operations. 
The main system parameters are listed in the following table, the kite, the suspended kite control unit (KCU) and the attached ram-air turbine for onboard power supply are shown in the following photos.

## Key measurements include:

- **Position, Orientation, Velocities, and Accelerations**: Recorded at two of the kite’s central struts using Pixhawk IMU+GPS systems, encompassing translational and rotational kinematics.
- **Airflow Measurements**: Collected using a pitot tube and wind vanes to measure angle of attack, sideslip angle, apparent windspeed and airspeed temperature. The sensor was installed in the front bridle lines of the kite. 
- **Tether Force**: Measured at the ground station using a load cell and an elevation angle encoder.

## Terms and requests concerning using the data:
The contents of this repository are published under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license: the data can be used as long as attribution is made to this repository. Nevertheless, if you pursue a publication that uses the data we request you to:
- Stress that the test flight does not represent the state-of-the-art of Kitepower as (1) the system configuration was already dated at the time of the test and has gone through substantial development since then and (2) the test was focused on data acquisition rather than maximising energy production;
- Acknowledge Kitepower and include a link to https://thekitepower.com;
- Send the preprint including the data via email to publications@kitepower.nl;
- Allow Kitepower to post the preprint of the publication on kitepower.nl and/or Kitepower-related networks, if such public posting is in accordance with the agreement between author and publisher.

## Wind estimation via EKF

We recommend using the [EKF-AWE](https://github.com/ocayon/EKF-AWE) repository for Extended Kalman Filter–based ambient wind estimation from flight data.

## Content of the data set

The acquired data is provided in csv-format. In the content description, we use the following abbreviations:
- NED: North-East-Down earth-fixed reference frame
- FRD: Forward-Right-Down body-fixed reference frame

### Kite kinematics measurements

- kite_0: Pixhawk unit 0 - Mounted on the central strut of the kite 
- kite_1: Pixhawk unit 1 - Mounted on the kite control unit (KCU)
  
The kite position data is derived from measurements taken by Pixhawk unit 0 and processed using the default Kalman filter implementation provided by Pixhawk.
